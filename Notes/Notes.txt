-----------
Processor is Hardware which understands only Binary numbers (0,1)

User input -> Calculator -> OS -> Processor
User input -> calculator -> OS System Routines -> Commands -> ZEROs and ONEs

Processor - 
Low level or Machine language - ZEROs and ONEs
Middle level or Assembly language - Commands
	Commands: add 2 2 , sub 2 2

OS -
System routines

Binary:
0 1 -> 0 1 2 3 4

0 - 0 0
1 - 0 1
2 - 1 0

2 power 0
2 power 1
2 power 2

Decimal:
10 power 0
10 power 1
10 power 2

Octal - 8
Hexa decimal - 16

What is Java?
Java is a Programing Language
Java is a High Level Programing Language

	High Level: Human understandable statements [print]
	High Level: Simple english like statements [print]

	Simple english like statements -> OS -> Processor
	Simple english like statements -> OS System routines -> Commands -> ZEROs and ONEs

Java follows OOPS Principles,
Java is a Object Oriented Programing Language

	Object Oriented Programing Language has 4 Principles
	1. Encapsulation
	2. Inheritance
	3. Abstraction
	4. Polymorphism

What we can develop using Java?
	Standalone applications (Calculator), Web applications(Netbanking) and Enterprise applications(SAP)
	
Which company developed Java?
	Sun Microsystem -> Oracle
	
Define Java?
	Java is a High Level, Object Oriented Programing Language used to develop Standalone, Web and Enterprise Applications developed by Sun Microsystem and Owned by Oracle.	
	
Introduction to JVM
	JVM: Java virtual machine
	It is Execution Engine in Java
	It is used run Java code
	
Explain Object Oriented Programing Language?
	1. Encapsulation
	2. Inheritance
	3. Abstraction
	4. Polymorphism
	
1. Encapsulation:
-----------------
	It is the process of binding data with its functionality together in a Single entity.
	We have to use Class and Object to Achieve Encapsulation.
	
	It is the process of binding data members with its methods together in a Single entity.
	
	Class {
		data - data member - variable
		functionality - method
	}
	
	Object1 {
		data = 3
		functionality = data + 6
	}
	
	Object2 {
		data = 4
		functionality = data + 6
	}

Class: it is logical structure
Object: it is a real entity representing Class

NumberPrcoesser:

public class NumberPrcoesser {
	
	// Variable
	int data;
	
	// Constructor
	public NumberPrcoesser(){
		data = 7;
	}
	
	// Method
	public void addAndPrint(){
		System.out.println(data + 7);
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] arr) {
		
		// Object
		NumberPrcoesser reference1 = new NumberPrcoesser();
		reference1.addAndPrint();

		// Object
		NumberPrcoesser reference2 = new NumberPrcoesser();
		reference2.data = 9;
		reference2.addAndPrint();
	}
}

output:
14
16

Class: It is a Logical structure, which contains variables, constructors and methods.

Object: It is a real entity. It is physical representation of the Class.

Variable: It is named memory location and hold the link to that memory location. it is used to access the data stored in that memory location.

Method: It is used define the functionality.

Constructor: It is a special method and used to initialize data members (Variables).

2. Inheritance
--------------
It is the process of establishing relationship between classes and Extending the Properties of one class into another class.

public class Anil {
	
	String car = "Kia";
	
	public void driveCar(){
		System.out.println("Driving car: "+ car);
	}	
}

public class Bharath extends Anil {

	String bike;
	
	public Bharath() {
		bike = "Pulser";
	}
	
	public void driveBike(){
		System.out.println("Driving bike: "+ bike);
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] a) {	
		Bharath b = new Bharath(); // Memory and Constructor -> What is the reference type
		
		b.driveCar();
		
		b.driveBike();
	}
}
O/P
Driving car: kia
Driving bike: Pulser
